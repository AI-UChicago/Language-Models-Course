# Language Models Course - AI@UChicago

The goal of this course is to aquaint attendees with the inner workings and uses of language models. It's by no means meant to be the end all be all course - given the time contrainsts, that would be nigh impossible.  Rather, this course should introduce the core topics surrounding language models in such a way that lays a foundational knowledge that attendees are able to fortify and build on as their journey in AI evolves. 

The first part of the course will have an emphasis on theory behind LMs with the idea of not only understanding _why_ and _how_ it works, but also the motivations behind the architectural decisions.  For this part, knowledge of neural networks and basic linear algebra will greatly enrich the experience.

The latter part will focus on interacting with these language models and give attendees a syntactical understanding of how to handle and train language models.

Python will be used throughout the course.
